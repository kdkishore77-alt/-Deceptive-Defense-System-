# -Deceptive-Defense-System-
Deceptive Defense System simulates resilience in critical infrastructure under deceptive attacks, modeling interactions between defenders, low-cost decoys, and rule-based attackers. It quantifies survival and cost tradeoffs, enabling analysis of optimal deception strategies for resource-constrained defense.
